            <h2>Which Car Tires Are Made in the USA?</h2>
                       <p>As of 2015, there are a number of vehicle tires made in the United States: 
                        B.F Goodrich, Bridgestone/Firestone, Cooper, Goodyear, Dunlop, Kelly-Springfield, Titan Tire and Yokohama Tire. 
                        The U.S. Department of Transportation requires all tires have a code indicating where the tires were made and by which company.
                        There are also many smaller tire companies with plants in the United States. For example, 
                        Gate’s Rubber Company and Mita’s Tires North America also operate from the U.S.
                        The U.S. DOT requires that all tires be marked with a code that provides information about the tire, called the Tire Identification Number. 
                        The Tire Identification Number begins with the letters “DOT.” The following two numbers or letters indicate where the tires were manufactured. 
                        The last four numbers show the week and year the tire was manufactured. </p>

                <h2>American Muscle Cars, Then and Now</h2>
                       <p>Some things are undeniably American and are so ingrained into our culture and collective memory that it's impossible to ignore them. 
                        In the automotive world, that honor falls to a few historic vehicles, but a whole category of cars was defined by young Americans' 
                        desire to go fast and break the rules.</p>

                <h2>American Muscle Diecast Cars</h2>
                        <p>The love of the American muscle car was born in the 1960s and early 1970s. 
                        This era created some of the most iconic muscle cars the world has ever seen. For hobbyists, 
                        this meant learning about different car specs and adding models to their collections from what was arguably the golden era of American automobile manufacturing.
                        Picking up 1:18 scale American Muscle diecast cars is an excellent way to advance your collection. 
                        Every facet of these models boasts quality detail, and at Auto World Store, we're sure to have the American Muscle replica you're after.</p>

                <h2>Why add Diecast Model Cars To Your Collection?</h2>
                        <p>The term "diecast model" refers to a collectible car, truck or other vehicle produced using die casting, which is a way of 
                        putting zinc metal or molten lead into a mold to cast a specific product. 
                        Miniature models with 1:18 scale are manufactured using die casting to capture every detail seen in the original vehicle.
                        The most common diecast models are scale representations of military vehicles, automobiles, trains, construction equipment and aircraft. 
                        The benefits of collecting diecast American Muscle cars and other models include: <br><br>
                        Premium construction: The heaviest and most luxurious models on the market are made through die casting.
                        Realistic features: You can usually open the sunroof, hood and doors of diecast cars.
